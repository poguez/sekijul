Wrappers and Agent Description
=================

sekijul currently has three packages for wrapping web services and providing answers to common questions regarding events information around the campus, such as date, time, place details.

newspr_wrapper.py wraps newspr.kaist.ac.kr and extracts scheduling information on upcoming cultural performances in campus(문화행사).
djacwrapper.py wraps djacwrapper.or.kr and provides scheduling information of performances from the Daejeon Culture & Arts Center(대전문화예술의전당).
The AraWrapper project wraps ara.kaist.ac.kr, an in-campus community board. It scans through articles from the campus announcement board and extracts event details.

How to use newspr_wrapper.py and djacwrapper.py:

$ PYTHONPATH=BeautifulSoup-3.2.0/ python2 manage.py shell

>>> import newspr_wrapper
>>> newspr_wrapper.saveNewsprEvents()

>>> import djacwrapper
>>> djacwrapper.saveDjacEvents()

See AraWrapper/README.txt for information on using AraWrapper.
